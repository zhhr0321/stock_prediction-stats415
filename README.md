Here's the final project for course DATASCI415. The problem that we are working on is "Forecasting stock price trends with market sentiment data".
# About the Method
We proposed our CNN-LSTM model which aims to better capture both the patten details and the time-sequence details. The model.ipynb file is our core model with each part comment, and the other experiment.ipynb file is the one that we used to run the comparison experiments.
# About the Dataset
It has been detailed revealed in the article.
